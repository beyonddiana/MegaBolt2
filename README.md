## Say what?

MEGAbolt is a text-forward metaverse client forked from an abandoned project. 
Its main purpose is to provide an alternative client to Linden Lab derived virtual world viewers. 
There is a strong focus on accessability and non-3D interaction.

## Disclaimer

MEGAbolt has *no* affiliation or endorsement from the METAbolt project or its author. 
MEGAbolt promises no compatiblity with plugins for said client and should be considered a seperate work entirely.

### Prerequisites

MEGAbolt requires .NET 5 and currently runs on the Windows x64 platform exclusively.

### Contributing

Pull requests are nice. Don't be a dick, and we will all get along just fine.
Do not pester contributors with basic questions like how to compile the software. It's a basic .NET project.
If you can't figure this out yourself, this project is not for you.
